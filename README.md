# Travis Gray's Readme Generator

## Description

![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/teknix420/TG-Readme-Generator/total?style=social)

This README Generator was developed to make creating a readme for future projects easier so I don't have to spend so much time going through the process of creating an entire layout for a Readme File.

This application will be used in the future and will be updated as necessary.

## Installation
            
This application doesn't need to be installed, only ran from a command line.
            
## Usage
            
- Make sure that Node.js is installed on your computer before proceeding.
- Save the repo to your computer.
- Open a command line in either VS Code, GitBash, or another alternative.
- Navigate to the main folder for the repo and type in:
	node index.js
- Navigate through the questions, filling out all of the info as needed. It will open a text editor such as notepad. Save the info and then close the editor once that section has been finished and the application will automatically continue.
- Pick 1 of 4 available licenses. You might need to Google them to see what they entail.
- Once all the questions have been answered, you'll get a confirmation that the files have been generated. Review them and make any necessary changes.
